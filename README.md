The app is meant to connect students with each other. If a student is in a course where there is a need for a lab partner, project group or other study-related things where you need to be connected with some other student in the same course. This is especially useful if you do not know anyone in the course you are taking. And maybe you also want to find someone to eat lunch with, then the app is supposed to help you find someone who may be a good lunch-companion for you. The app is built on chatrooms for each course where you can chat with the others taking the same course. Each student has a profile where they can write about themselves to make it easier for other students to make a qualified choice when pairing up for labs for example. You should also be able to send private messages to other students without having to write to everyone in the chatroom.
